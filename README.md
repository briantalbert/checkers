## Introduction 

In trying to practice Java, I decided to create Checkers. I found out that Checkers is a much more complicated game than I had originally thought.

## Features

Right now, the game is Human vs. Human. I plan to implement a basic AI in the future. The one standard Checkers rule not yet implemented is multi-jumping, but that is on the todo list as well.

## Installation

Navigate to /src/
javac -cp checkers/Game.java
java checkers/Game

## How to play

Red player goes first. Under the board, a list of pieces that can be moved will be listed. Enter the number indicating the coordinates of the piece you wish to move. Then a list of available moves will show. Enter the number indicating the move you wish to make. Moves that can capture an opponent's piece will be marked with an star.
